# API for [jess.gallery](https://jess.gallery)

API with all the content.

> This is a WIP, and under building. I'll update the README afterwards.

## Running

In order to run, you'll need node 9.2 â€“ technically, everything starting from 7.6 should work, since I use async/await, but I haven't tried it myself.

Also, you need to have MYSQL installed and running. On mac OS, you need to execute `mysql.server start`.

```
mysql.server start
npm install
npm start
```
